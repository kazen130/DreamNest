    <h2>About This Website</h2>
    <p>
      This website was created especially for Mizo users who love watching animated movies in Mizo language.  
      Our goal is to make it simple, small, and easy to use — even if your connection is slow or your device is not powerful.
    </p>

    <p>
      We're using a free host (Aimeo), so the website may not look perfect or fast, and the video quality might not be the best right now.  
      We sincerely apologize for that.
    </p>

    <p>
      But we're working hard to improve everything — better design, better quality, and more Mizo version movies and series are coming soon!
    </p>

    <p>
      Thank you so much for visiting and supporting. We hope you enjoy your time here.
